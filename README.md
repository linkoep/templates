# Templates
This repository contains any templates (LaTeX, Word, etc.) that I use to do homework and other schoolwork.

### My Workflow
I like to work in the terminal, so normally all that is involved is
```
cp path/to/template path/to/template && vim templatename.tex
```
For my most common templates I have this command aliased to something
```
alias dohomework="cp path/to/template path/to/template && vim templatename.tex"
```
Pretty simple, but I find it saves me time, and stops me from procrastinating and having to look up the structure of a LaTeX document every week.
